Bowling Tournament Engine (Racket)

This is a high-complexity logic engine that calculates scores for full bowling tournaments.

Technical Highlights:

Complex Logic: Implemented the "look-ahead" scoring rules for strikes and spares using recursive list processing.

Data Aggregation: Built functions to aggregate individual player scores into team totals and identify the tournament "Most Valuable Player."

Pattern Matching: Leveraged Racket's match capabilities to handle different frame types (Strikes, Spares, Open Frames) cleanly.
